# Welcome to what I know to be the first repository of Ark Survival Ascended Nitrado Server Settings. 
## Please keep in mind that these settings if altered by you or any others could affect the performance of your server. Under the agreed License, if you choose to copy and alter these settings, I myself and the source code are not held responsible.

The current v1.0 will consist of commented out portions of code that you can copy and paste. Keep in mind that Nitrado's ini files might not recognize the standard ";" as a commented block of code. Be sure to remove any commented settings before deploying and restarting your server

Join ArkoholicAnonymous server and discord for updates and commentary. If possible, please donate to the server to keep it running
